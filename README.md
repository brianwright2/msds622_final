## MSDS 622 Data Visualization Final
### Brian Wright


This repository is the home of my final project for the course MSDS-622: Data Visualization. The project consists of choosing a datset and composing several different visualizations regarding the data, culminating in a story explaning an interesting insight developed from the data. The pdf linked [here](https://github.com/brianwright2/msds622_final/blob/master/final_report.pdf) contains a writeup containing explanations on the data, all of the visualizations, and the storyline and conclusion.
